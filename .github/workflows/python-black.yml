# Black: Python linter
# This action lints python using black - a python code formatter.
# https://github.com/psf/black
# This does not format the code, this only detects and informs on issues.
# To format with black, run `black .` locally in the repository.

# Action failing? Run `black .` locally in the repository to fix issues.
