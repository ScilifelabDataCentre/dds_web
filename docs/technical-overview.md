## 1. What is the Data Delivery System?

The Data Delivery System (DDS) is a tool built for the simple and secure delivery of data from
SciLifeLab platforms to their users. The system uses Safespring’s[^2] object storage service as the
delivery medium, thereby keeping the data within the Swedish borders. The DDS has built-in
encryption and key management, enabling protection of the data without requiring the users to
perform these steps themselves prior to delivery.

![Overview diagram of the DDS](docs/img/dds_overview.svg "Overview of DDS")

The DDS has been developed by the SciLifeLab Data Centre together with NGI Stockholm. The web
interface can be found at <https://delivery.scilifelab.se> and the documentation at
[GitHub pages](https://scilifelabdatacentre.github.io/dds_cli/).

### What is it not?

The system is not a storage solution; The data will only be stored for a short period of time[^3] and the
recipients are themselves responsible for the future handling of their data. Backup of the data is not
provided during the data delivery. The system is also not built for data sharing; it is purely for delivery
of data from one data producer to a data owner.

## 2. How is it used?

The DDS is hosted on a Kubernetes cluster[^4] owned and maintained by the SciLifeLab Data Centre.
The system consists of two main components: a web part (“web”) and a REST API (“API”). The vast
majority of the DDS functionality resides in the API, which can be utilized via the DDS command line
interface (CLI). At this time, the web can be used for user registration ([Registration](#registration)), changing and
resetting passwords and listing the projects. In addition, the web links to the code base,
documentation, troubleshooting information, this technical overview and the Python Package Index
([PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/dds-cli/)). In order to meet the needs of more users (e.g. those not as familiar with
the command line) we plan to include more functionality currently present in the CLI into the web.
This section describes the standard DDS use-case and the flow of data within the system. The steps
do not include actions taken prior to data delivery, such as sample collection, the production of the
data or the communication between customer (user) and SciLifeLab platform.
Accounts within the system will be referred to by the role of the account in question.

- A Super Admin refers to the person behind a DDS account with the role “Super Admin”.
- A Unit Admin refers to the person behind a DDS account with the role “Unit Admin”. Unit
  Admins are associated with a SciLifeLab unit.
- A Unit Personnel refers to the person behind a DDS account with the role “Unit Personnel”.
  Unit Personnel are associated with a SciLifeLab unit.
- A Researcher refers to the person behind a DDS account with the role “Researcher”. A
  Researcher is any person who uses the services of a SciLifeLab unit.
- A Project Owner refers to the person behind a DDS account with the role “Researcher”, but
  who is marked as the owner of a specific project. For more information on the account roles
  and their permissions within the DDS, please see the appendix ([User Roles](#a-user-roles)).

### 2.1. Delivery Overview

Sections 2.2 to 2.11 provide a more detailed description of the following steps.

1. A Super Admin creates a unit in the DDS
2. A Super Admin invites Unit Admins
3. The Unit Admins register their accounts in the DDS
4. The Unit Admins invite Unit Personnel
5. The Unit Personnel register their accounts in the DDS
6. A Unit Admin/Personnel creates a project
7. A Unit Admin/Personnel uploads data
8. A Unit Admin/Personnel releases the data to the recipient
9. A Researcher/Project Owner downloads data
10. The project status is automatically changed to expired after a number of days
11. If the project status has not been changed to available again within a number of days, the
    project is automatically archived

### 2.2. Creating a Unit in the DDS

In order to begin using the DDS, a SciLifeLab platform or unit must contact the SciLifeLab Data
Centre at [delivery@scilifelab.se](mailto:delivery@scilifelab.se). When the necessary agreements are in place, the Data
Centre should have the following information; The information is required in order to add the unit to the
production instance, and should be collected from the agreements or additional contact with the unit.

| Unit Name*                                        | The name of the unit or platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| External Unit Name                                | The unit name to display to users e.g. in emails. If not specified by the unit, the Data Centre will set this to the same value as Unit Name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Contact Email*                                    | The email address on which the unit would like to be contacted regarding the DDS. This address will be displayed in some emails sent by the DDS and on the web page, e.g. when renewal of project access is required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Public ID                                         | An identifier for the SciLifeLab unit (e.g. abbreviation of the SciLifeLab unit name) which may be displayed publicly. If not chosen by the unit, the Data Centre will choose an appropriate abbreviation. Preferably, this ID should be a short abbreviation of the unit name, and should adhere to the following rules. Only contain letters, digits, dots (.) and hyphens (-). Begin with a letter or digit. Contain a maximum of two dots. Not start with “xn--”.                                      |
| Internal reference ID                             | At this time, this specifies the prefix of the public ID of the future projects within the unit, and should adhere to the same rules as the Public ID. If this ID is not set, the value will default to the Public ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Days in Available                                 | The number of days during which the data will be available for download by the Researchers. The countdown starts when the project is released. There is no time limit when the project is In Progress and the project has not been released. For more information on the project statuses and what actions can be performed during them, see the appendix ([Project Statuses](#b-project-statuses)). After Days in Available (DiA) number of days has passed, the project is automatically set as Expired. |
| Days in Expired                                   | The number of days (after being available) during which the data is still stored but not available for download. During this time, the project can be renewed, leading to the project being available again and therefore allowing for downloads again. When the Days in Expired (DiE) number of days has passed, the project is automatically archived by the system.                                                                                                                                     |
| Quota                                             | The amount of storage space made available for a particular unit. This information should be included in the service agreement. Another value cannot be chosen by the Data Centre or by the unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Warning level                                     | When a unit has used this percentage of it’s available storage space, an alert is triggered and sent to the contact email within the unit, as well as a to [delivery@scilifelab.se](mailto:delivery@scilifelab.se). In the event of an alert, the unit affected should contact the Data Centre to discuss whether or not the quota is sufficient. If not, the service agreement will need to be updated and the quota increased in both the database and at Safespring's S3 storage, for that specific Safespring project.                                                   |
: Parameters used to configure a Unit within DDS 

The unit also must provide the email addresses of at least two (but preferably three or more)
individuals which should have the DDS account role Unit Admin. For more information on why this
is required, see the section [Creating a Project](#creating-a-project).

When this information has been received, the Data Centre contacts Safespring in order to create a
new Safespring project (not to be confused with a delivery project). The Safespring project is the
location within the cloud where the uploaded data will be stored. When a Safespring project is
created, the DDS Product Owner (“PO”) receives the following information from Safespring:

Keys
: Access key and secret key. These are created within Safespring and can be retrieved from there by the Data Centre.

Endpoint
: The storage site. This is currently the same for all, but may change in the future, either for all or some of the
Safespring projects.

Name
: A unique name for the Safespring project. This is currently not used for anything aside from keeping track but will
be useful information once the invoicing system has been implemented.

A system administrator (sysadmin) in the Data Centre accesses the DDS deployment and runs a
command using the information described above. This inserts the unit information into the database.
The database is encrypted with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Counter (CTR) mode,
with a 512 bit key.

### 2.3. Registration

In order to obtain an account, another user already having an account in the system needs to send
an invite [^5]. When a unit is first created in the DDS, the Super Admin invites Unit Admins to the specific
unit. When invited, the Unit Admin receives an email from the DDS with the subject “[USER] invites
you to the SciLifeLab Data Delivery System“. The email contains a link to the registration page. When
following the link, the user is prompted to enter the following information. All fields are required.

: Required information to create any user in DDS

Once a Unit Admin has registered an account, they can invite Unit Personnel. Unit Personnel can
only be invited to the unit to which the Unit Admin is connected. Super Admins, Unit Admins and Unit
Personnel can all invite Researchers. All invited users get identical emails as described above, and
register their account in the DDS by following the link and filling in the same required information.

### 2.4. Authentication

Before delivering data with the CLI, it needs to be installed (see the
[Installation Guide](https://scilifelabdatacentre.github.io/dds_cli/installation/) located in
GitHub pages) and all users are required to authenticate themselves. The authentication process
via CLI is as follows.

1. The user runs [^6] the authentication command and the CLI asks for the username and
   password.
2. Assuming the username and password are correct, the user is asked to authenticate with
   two factor authentication (2FA). The first authentication requires 2FA via email: An email
   containing an eight digit code is sent to the user's registered email and the user is prompted
   to enter the code. After this, the user can set up 2FA via authenticator app [^7] if they wish. If
   not, the default method of 2FA via email will be used for all authentication within the DDS.
3. Assuming that the 2FA succeeds, an encrypted token is saved on the local machine or server,
   depending on where the command is executed. This token acts as an authenticated session
   and will be used in the succeeding commands. The default destination of the encrypted
   authenticated token is the home directory. If a specific destination is specified in the
   authentication command, the token will be saved in that location [^8]. The token is valid for seven
   days. We highly recommend you to re-authenticate before uploading or downloading any
   data [^9].
   The same procedure is followed when logging into the web; The username and password is entered,
   followed by 2FA with the chosen 2FA method. The web session however, in contrast to the CLI
   session, only lasts for one hour. If a user is inactive for more than one hour, they will be asked to log
   in again. As a final note on the authentication process, a user can attempt the authentication via CLI
   and login via the web a maximum of ten times in one hour.

### 2.5. Inviting users

The CLI is used to invite any type of user[^10]. The following list describes which roles can invite which
roles, if any, and if there are any exceptions or additional important information to note.

+----------------+------------------+----------------+------------------+-----------------------+
| Inviter role   | Invitee role     |                |                  |                       |

### 2.6. Creating a Project

Unless otherwise stated, a project refers to a delivery project - a container in the DDS to which a unit
uploads one or more data files to be delivered to a researcher.

Both Unit Admins and Unit Personnel can create delivery projects for their unit. However, a unit will
not be able to create any delivery projects until there are at least two accounts with the role “Unit
Admin” for the specific unit. The reasoning behind this is explained below:

---

- When a user registers an account in the DDS ([Registration](#registration)), a key pair is generated
  (“user key pair”) for that specific user. The public part of this pair (“user public
  key”) is stored in the database without any protection apart from the encryption
  affecting the entire database. The private part of the key pair (“user private key”),
  however, is encrypted by a key derived from the password chosen during registration
  and thereafter saved to the database.

- A key pair is also generated when a project is created (“project key pair”). In the
  same way as the user public key, the public part of the project key pair (“project
  public key”) is saved to the database without an extra layer of encryption. The
  private part (“project private key”) is encrypted with the user public key.

- The above means that the project private key can only be decrypted with the user
  private key, which can only be decrypted with a key derived from the user's password.
  Since the project private key is required for decrypting all data within a specific
  project, forgetting the DDS password and resetting it also results in the loss of
  data access. Note that this is not the case for changing the password, where the
  user logs in to the web and provides the old password in order to set a new one.
  This does not affect the data access in any form.

- The reasoning behind requiring at least two Unit Admins for a specific unit is
  to reduce the risk that all Unit Admins associated with a specific unit lose access
  to the project data at the same time. If this would occur, they would not be able to
  fix the others access [^12] and Unit Personnel cannot fix the project access for Unit
  Admins.

- Note: Users only choose and keep track of their username and password. All other
  keys are generated by the system and stored in the database.

---

If a unit has two Unit Admins, any user attempting to create a project will be prompted with a warning,
informing them of the risk of data access loss [^13]. Once a unit has at least three Unit Admins this
warning will disappear.

The following information is required (and saved to the database) when creating a project:

Title
: The title of the project. There is no upper limit to the length of this,
however it must be at least one character long and it can only contain
letters, digits and spaces - special characters are not allowed. It is
also not unique; there can be multiple projects with identical titles.

Description
: A description of the project. It needs to be at least one character long,
but there is no upper limit. In addition to letters, digits and spaces,
special characters are allowed in the description.

Principal Investigator
: An email address to the Principal Investigator (PI). Note that this
email address is not used for anything other than information at this
time. It is not connected to any DDS account, and they receive no
emails. This is due to the fact that some PIs are not involved in the
data collection, and may be listed as the PI as a formality. Thus, the
PI does not necessarily have to have a DDS account. If the PI should
receive emails and have a DDS account with access to your project,
we suggest that you set the same person as the Project Owner. This
can be done in two ways:

1. Creating a project and then adding users to the project[^14].
2. Creating a project and at the same time specifying which Researchers should have access and which user(s) should
   be set as an owner[^15].

In addition to this, the following information is generated for each project:

Public ID
: The public ID is generated from the Internal Reference ID ([Creating a Unit
in the DDS](#creating-a-unit-in-the-dds)) and a counter. Thus, each project public ID associated with a
specific unit will have the same prefix. For example, if the Internal
Reference ID for the associated unit is intref, the first project created for
that unit would be intref00001, the second intref00002, and so on.

Bucket
: The name of the project-specific bucket with the Safespring project. This
is generated from the public ID, the current time (Date Created below)
and a randomly generated string of characters.

Date Created
: A timestamp representing the date and time when the project was
created.

Date Updated
: A timestamp representing the date and time when the project was last
updated, e.g. a folder or file was deleted.

Key Pair
: As described in the beginning of this section, a key pair is generated for
each project. This key pair consists of a public and a private part. The
public part (“project public key”) is saved together with the project
information and there is a single copy. The private part (“project private
key”) is encrypted with the user public key of each user with access to the
project in question. Thus, there is one copy of the project private key per user.

Sensitive
: Information on whether the project is regarded as sensitive or not. If any
sensitive data, such as (for example) human related data, will be
delivered at any stage in a delivery project, the project should be set as
sensitive. This is the default. There is an option to specify that the project
can be regarded as non-sensitive, however at this time the handling of
sensitive and non-sensitive project data are identical: all data is encrypted
and decrypted. This may change in a future version.

Released
: Information on whether or not the project data has been released (project
status set to “Available”) at some point. For more information on the
project statuses, please see the appendix ([Project Statuses](#b-project-statuses)).

Active
: Whether or not the project is currently active. The default is active. The
following statuses are regarded as active: - In Progress - Available - Expired
The following statuses are regarded as non-active: - Deleted - Archived (incl. aborted)

### 2.7. Uploading data

Once a project has been created, the project status is automatically set to In Progress. This status
(and this status only) allows for upload of data within the project[^16]. Only Unit Admins and Unit
Personnel have the permissions to upload data.
When starting an upload, a directory (“staging directory”) is created by the executing command. The
default location of the staging directory is the current working directory, however the user can specify
an existing directory in which the staging directory should be placed. Independent of the location
(specified or default), the staging directory is named _DataDelivery\_\<timestamp\>\_\<project_id\>\_upload_,
where \<timestamp\> is the date and time when the upload was started, and \<project_id\> is the ID of
the project the user is attempting to upload data to. If there is no data to upload, this directory is
deleted immediately. If not, the staging directory will contain three subdirectories:

logs

: The logs directory will be empty if the upload is successful. If an error occurs
during the upload, a log file called `"dds_failed_delivery.json"` will be
created and placed in the logs directory. If the actual upload to the cloud is
successful but the file information (e.g. name, checksum, size etc.) fails to be
saved to the database, the log file lets the PO insert the missing file data into the
database. Without this information, the uploaded file(s) will be located in the
cloud but will not be accessible by any of the user roles since there is no record
of it/them in the database. Thus, in the case of this log file being generated,
contact the Data Centre immediately and attach the log file to the message. If
you do not contact us with this information, the DDS cleanup actions[^17] will:
    - Remove the files found in the cloud which are missing database metadata
    - Remove rows in the database which are missing the corresponding file in the cloud

files
: This is the subdirectory where the actual staging occurs. Prior to the upload of
a file, the DDS checks whether or not the file appears to be compressed by
examining the file signature contained in the first few bytes of the file. If the file
appears to be compressed, no compression is performed on the file. If the file
appears to be in raw format, it is compressed by the DDS[^18]. As mentioned
previously, all files are also encrypted. When encrypting (and possibly
compressing) the files, the new files (“staged files”) are placed in the files
directory. As soon as the file has been uploaded, the staged file is deleted. The
original file is not affected.

meta
: The meta directory will always be empty. This is a remnant of a previous version
and has not yet been removed.
The staging process and upload is executed with several concurrent threads. This means that the
DDS does not handle one file at a time. Instead, the default is for the DDS to stage and upload four
files at a given time. However, this may vary (e.g. may be less) depending on the computer or server
capabilities, and can also be changed by using one of the CLI options. Assuming that the default is
used and that more than four files are included in the ongoing upload, there will be a maximum of
four progress bars displayed in the terminal. The file names are displayed to the left of the bars, and
to the left of the file names is the current ongoing process for each file. A lock indicates that a file is
being compressed and encrypted, and an arrow pointing up indicates that the file is being uploaded
to the bucket.
Uploading the same data (files or directories with the same names/paths) again will by default not
succeed. However, the user can explicitly tell the DDS to upload the same data again - to overwrite
the current file information in the database and to upload a new version of the files. This will generate
a new file version in the database, which is kept track of for invoicing purposes.

Uploading data to the cloud requires collection[^19] of the Safespring keys which provides the
connection between the CLI and Safesprings cloud storage. The plan is to change this to use a
similar method as what the download ([Downloading data](#downloading-data)) uses - pre-signed urls. The plan is also to
allow for the continuation of a failed upload. Currently, a failed upload requires the restart of the
process. For a detailed flowchart describing the upload process, see the [Flowcharts](#d-flowcharts).

### 2.8. Releasing the data

The project status In Progress does not allow for any data download by Researchers. In order to
give the Researchers access to the data, the project needs to have the status Available[^20]. The
process of changing the project status from In Progress to Available is hereby referred to as
“releasing” the data/project. When the data is released, the countdown of the DiA[^21] ([Creating a
Unit in the DDS](#creating-a-unit-in-the-dds)) starts, and upload is no longer possible. In the case that some file has been missed
during the upload, the Unit Admin/Personnel can change the project status from Available to In
Progress (“retracting”). This lets the Unit Admin/Personnel continue uploading files and prevents
any downloads by the Researchers. However, retracting the project does not pause the countdown
of DiA. When DiA number of days have passed, the project status is automatically set to Expired.
The deadline for a given project can be extended by Unit Admins or Personnel. 
More information on this can be found in section [Automatic expiry of data access](#automatic-expiry-of-data-access-and-archiving-of-project).
Releasing the data also, by default, notifies the Researchers that there is data available for
download. If the unit does not want these emails to be sent, it can be disabled when performing the
status change.

### 2.9. Downloading data

Once the project has been released, the Researchers with access to the project can begin
downloading the data. Available is the only status that allows for data download by Researchers,
and upload and deletion of any project contents by Unit Admin and Unit Personnel is not possible.
When downloading data, the Researchers can either choose to download specific file(s), specific
folder(s), or the entire project contents.

As with the upload ([Uploading data](#uploading-data)), a staging directory is created when downloading the data. This
directory is placed by default in the current working directory, and is named _DataDelivery\_\<timestamp\>\_\<project_id\>\_download_.
However unlike the upload command, downloading allows the user to choose the name of the directory - specifying a
destination. The destination cannot be an existing directory[^22] - it must be a new directory. Since a new destination is required with every
download, downloading the same file(s) multiple times is possible and is only limited by the amount
of available storage space on the client (computer or server where the command is run).
The staging directory contains the same subdirectories as the upload creates, however the usage
of them differs slightly.

logs
: The logs directory will be empty if the download is successful. If an error occurs
: The logs directory will be empty if the download is successful. If an error occurs
during the download, a log file called `"dds_failed_delivery.json"` will be
created and placed in the logs directory. In the case of this log file being
generated, contact the Data Centre and attach the log file to the message.

files
: This is the subdirectory where the actual staging occurs. This is also the final
destination of the downloaded and decrypted files. All downloaded files are
saved to this location. Succeeding the download, all files are decrypted and
those that were initially compressed by the DDS prior to upload are
decompressed. As soon as a file has been decrypted and decompressed, the
staged (downloaded) file is deleted from the files subdirectory. Downloading
data does not affect any of the files in the cloud.

meta
: As during upload, the meta directory will always be empty.
The download and decryption/decompression process is also executed with several concurrent
threads. As for the upload, the download also has four as the default number of threads and this is
adjustable in the same way. Assuming that the default is used and that more than four files are
included in the ongoing download, there will be a maximum of four progress bars displayed in the
terminal. The file names are displayed to the left of the bars, and to the left of the file names is the
current ongoing process for each file. An arrow pointing up indicates that the file is being downloaded
from the bucket, and a lock indicates that a file is being decrypted and decompressed.
In contrast to the upload, the download of data from the cloud does not require the collection of the
Safespring keys. Instead, the download is handled with the use of pre-signed urls. These urls are
generated and cryptographically signed within the DDS when a user is attempting to download the
data. If the download of a file fails, the process must start from scratch again. For a detailed flowchart
describing the download process, see the [Flowcharts](#d-flowcharts).

### 2.10. Automatic expiry of data access and archiving of project

After DiA number of days, the DDS automatically changes the project status to Expired. This starts
the countdown of the DiE number of days. In this status, all data and metadata is kept in the system,
but all uploads, downloads and deletions of data by all roles are blocked. After DiE days, the project
status is automatically changed to Archived. This is the end of a project life cycle[^23] and all files are
deleted.
If Researchers associated with the project need access to download the data, they must contact the
responsible SciLifeLab unit. A Unit Admin or Unit Personnel within the DDS can then change the
project status to Available again, thereby allowing for download and resetting the countdown of the
DiA. Similarly, if additional data should be delivered in the project, a Unit Admin or Unit Personnel
must first change the project status to Available and from there to In Progress[^24].
The renewal of data access can be performed a maximum of two times. Once a project expires, it
can be released again, then expire again and then released one last time. After this, the project
expires, and can then only be archived.

# Appendix

## A User Roles

There are four different roles in the DDS: “Super Admin”, “Unit Admin”, “Unit Personnel” and
“Researcher”. The figure below shows a simplification of the permission hierarchy of these roles:

- Researchers can list projects and their contents and download data, but only have
  administrative permissions if they are set as an owner of a specific project.
- Unit Personnel can list projects and their contents, download data, upload data and delete it.
  They also have administrative permissions regarding other Unit Personnel and Researchers.
- Unit Admins can list projects, their contents, download data, upload data and delete data.
  They have administrative permissions regarding other Unit Admins and also Unit Personnel
  and Researchers.
- Super Admins do not have access to any data but have administrative permissions regarding
  all other roles, including other Super Admins.

![Schematic showing relationship between DDS roles](docs/img/dds_roles.svg "Relationship between the roles")

### Super Admin

The Super Admin role is reserved for certain employees of the SciLifeLab Data Centre.
The table below shows which permissions a Super Admin has (“Yes”) and does not have (“No”). \* indicates
that the permissions relate to all roles. If a role has a permission relating to one or more specific roles, these
roles are listed below the permission.

: Permissions of Unit Personnel

### Researcher

The Researcher role represents the data recipient. Project Owner is a subcategory of the Researcher
role, and is intended for those Researchers that should have some administrative permissions within
specific projects. Thus, the Project Owner is not a DDS user role, but a “role” within a certain project.
The first table below reflects the permissions of Researchers in general. The second table reflects
the permissions of Researches which have been marked as Project Owners within a specific project.

The table below shows which permissions a Researcher has (“Yes”) and does not have (“No”). \* indicates
that the permissions relate to all roles. If a role has a permission relating to one or more specific roles, these
roles are listed below the permission.

## B Project Statuses

There are five different possible project statuses available within the DDS. The section [“How is it
used?”](#how-is-it-used) describes the standard project life cycle, from creating a project with the automatic status In
Progress, to project archivation. The figure below shows a summary of the different statuses and
what they mean. The rest of this section describes them in more detail.

![Schematic showing lifecycle of DDS projects](docs/img/dds_project_statuses.svg "Lifecycle of DDS projects")

### In Progress

A project is automatically set to In Progress when it’s created. This status is to allow upload by Unit
Admins and Unit Personnel and indicate that the data delivery is in progress. If invited to a project
during this stage, Researchers can also see the project in their list of projects, however they cannot
see if anything has been uploaded.
The permissions of Unit Admins and Unit Personnel vary depending on whether or not the project
has just been created (A. First time as In Progress), or if it has been released and later retracted one
or more times (B. Nth time as In Progress).

#### A. First time as In Progress

The first time as In Progress, data can be uploaded, downloaded, deleted and overwritten. The
project can also be Deleted, indicating that something has gone wrong before the data was released
to the recipients.

#### B. Nth time as In Progress

If the project has been made Available and then retracted to In Progress again, deleting the project
is no longer an option. In this case, the Unit Admin or Unit Personnel will need to archive the project
and indicate that the project is aborted[^25]. Deleting and overwriting files is also not an option at this
stage. This is a design choice and reduces the risk of Researchers downloading incomplete or
changed data.

### Deleted

A project can only be deleted if it has the status In Progress and it has not been previously released
to the recipients. The Deleted status is to indicate that something has gone wrong, e.g. project
information is incorrect.
When a project is deleted, all data is deleted from the cloud. In addition, all project metadata aside
from the bucket name is deleted from the database. The name of the bucket is required for invoicing
purposes and keeping track of that there are no residual files left after deletion. The deletion of a
project is not reversible - once a project is deleted, it cannot be used for delivery again.

### Available

When a project is released, all roles (aside from Super Admins) have access to the data.
Researchers can now download the project data. Upload is no longer possible. If additional data
must be uploaded within the same project, a Unit Admin or Unit Personnel can retract the project,
thereby setting the status to In Progress again.
An Available project cannot be deleted. If the project should be closed, a Unit Admin or Unit
Personnel can do this by archiving the project. To indicate that something has gone wrong and that
the project life cycle has deviated from the standard, use the abort flag. If nothing has gone wrong
and the project should simply be closed due to that the data has been downloaded by the users, the
archivation command can be used as is.
When a project is released (from In Progress), the countdown of DiA begins. After this number of
days have passed, the project is automatically expired.

### Expired

The project status Expired can only occur if DiA days pass - a project cannot be expired via the CLI.
When the status is changed to Expired, the countdown of the DiE number of days starts. In this
status, all data and metadata is kept in the system, but all uploads, downloads and deletions of data
by all roles are blocked. After DiE days, the project status is automatically changed to Archived. This
is the end of a project life cycle and all files are deleted. Metadata, however, is kept.
In the case that the data recipients do not download the data in time, they can contact one of the Unit
Admins or Unit Personnel connected to the unit responsible for the project. These roles then have
the necessary permissions to release the project data again. Once released again, this starts the
countdown of DiA again.
The renewal of data access can be performed a maximum of two times. Once a project expires, it
can be released again, then expire again and then released one last time. After this, the project
expires, and can then only be archived.

### Archived

An archived project marks the end of a project life cycle. This is not reversible. All data is deleted
and all metadata is kept.

### Aborted

An archived project can also be marked as aborted. This indicates that data has been (either
intentionally or accidentally) shared with the recipients and that something has gone wrong during
the data delivery. It can also indicate that the Unit Admin or Unit Personnel wishes for the project
metadata to be deleted, which it is not if the project is simply archived.

## C Keys

Information on the user- and project keys are coming.

## D Flowcharts

This section shows flowcharts describing the DDS. The flowcharts are of varying sizes and some
can therefore be difficult to follow and read. To see these in a better resolution, please
[see here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ophR0vtGByHxPG90mzjAPXgMTCjVcN_Z/view?usp=sharing).
Note that after clicking the link, you need to click the “open with”, “diagrams.net” and
then authorize with google to access it. The flowcharts are located in the tab “Flowcharts”, found at
the bottom of the board. These will most likely be available in a different format later, e.g. not
requiring access to the diagrams.net page.

    An invite is valid for 7 days. At this time, there is no clean up functionality to remove unanswered invites,
    however the invitee can follow the expired invite link to deactivate it completely or the inviter can remove the
    invite. Both of these alternatives can then be followed by a new invite to the same user if needed.

    If a custom destination is chosen during authentication you also must specify the path to the token in all

[^9]:
    We’re looking into the possibility of authenticating during an ongoing delivery to reduce the risk of a failed
    delivery due to an expired token. This is not implemented at this time. Therefore, if the delivery is not finished
    before the token expires, the ongoing upload or download will fail.

    “Data access loss” refers to the occasion that no user connected to a specific unit has access to download
    and decrypt data within a specific project. Super Admins can not help with this since they do not have access
    to any of the data.

    When releasing a project, the default DiA is the value set during unit creation in the DDS. It is possible,
    however, to specify a custom DiA for a specific project by using the deadline option in the release command.

    This was originally to avoid any overwriting of existing files, however it has been brought to our attention
    that the ability to specify the same staging directory for several downloads would be a welcome feature. There
    is a plan to look into this.

[^23]: The project is set to non-active.

    Note that it may be a good idea to use the –no-mail flag in this case to avoid Researchers receiving email
    notifications regarding available data.
