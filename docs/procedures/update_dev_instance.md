# How to update the development instance

A new feature should always be tested on the development instance of the DDS **before** it's released in production. When a new feature is added and pushed to the `dev` branch, the development instance (`dds-dev`) should be redeployed.

Redeployments of the development instance can be done at any time. No planning required.

1.  Merge change into `dev`. A GitHub action publishes the image to GHCR.
2.  Perform redeployment of dev instance

    - A member of the team has access to the development deployment: They can do the redeployment themselves. This is only OK in the development instance.
    - No team members have access to the deployment / they are not available:

      1.  Go to the [sysadmin repository](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/sysadmin/issues)
      2.  Create a new issue and fill in the following information

          `Title`

              DDS: Redeploy the development instance (`dds-dev`)

          `Leave a comment`

              Please redeploy the dev instance of the DDS.

              Fill in the [manual log](https://scilifelab.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/deliveryportal/pages/2318729217/Development+Test) on Confluence.
