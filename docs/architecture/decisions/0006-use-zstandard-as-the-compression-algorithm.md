# 6. Use Zstandard as the compression algorithm

Date: 2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Gzip (GNU zip ) is one of the most popular compression algorithms and is suitable for compression of data streams, is supported by all browsers and comes as a standard in all major web servers. However, while gzip provides a good compression ratio , it is very slow compared to other algorithms. Since there is a variety of different compression algorithms it became unreasonable to test every alternative. Instead, prior knowledge about the algorithm Zstandard lead to the choice of comparing gzip with Zstandard.

## Decision

Use Zstandard as the compression algorithm within DDS.

## Consequences

To test the usefulness of the two options, they were tested in the processing chain together with the chosen encryption algorithm. The encryption speed using ChaCha20-Poly1305 (in mentioned case tested on a 109 MB file) is around 600 MB/s , but when adding compression as a preceding step, the speed was less than 3 MB/s and the compression ratio 3,25. Since the delivery system will be dealing with huge files, itâ€™s important that the processing is efficient, and therefore that the chosen algorithms are fast. Due to this, Zstandard was tested with the same chunk size, resulting in a speed of 119 MB/s and a compression ratio of 3,1. Zstandard thus gave approximately the same compression ratio in a fraction of the time.
